When selecting a grey 3 with a four 1s underneath, the grey 1 bonus gave 2 additional dice on the bonus ladder


/******Cannot replicate:******/
After having returned the white dice to the pool earlier in the turn, the white dice appeared as yellow when moved to the dice plate at turn end.
Getting all the grey 1s didn't trigger the bonus
When white (5) was selected from diceMat and used as a green on fifth box, it resulted in 18 instead of 15. Replicated again - seems to always do the best green.
As yellow dice was added to the plate, it was registered in the console as yellow, but came up as green on the plate.
As green (1) was taken for the fourth green box, it triggered a yellow bonus instead of a blue one.
