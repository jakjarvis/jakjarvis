This is the source code for my Resume website at jakjarvis.com.

'updated' branch:
- This is a modified version of a template forked from Dan Browne, which was the first website I used for my CV.

Master branch:
- The master branch has now been created entirely from scratch by me based on lessons learned in Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML Udemy course.
